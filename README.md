Exploring different methods for collaborative filtering.

PROJECT GOALS
-------------
The goal with the project was to explore User-based and Item-based Collaborative Filtering methods. 
The dataset used was the MovieLens dataset retrived from: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k
Dataset also available here: https://www.kaggle.com/prajitdatta/movielens-100k-dataset

LIMITATIONS
-----------
Because this code was run on a local machine, the smaller dataset of 100k movies was the one used. Larger datasets from MovieLens are avaialble on their website.
